## üìã FORMULA ADDITIONS (All Brokers)

### Apply Complete Pricing Formulas?

For ALL brokers, I found complete formulas that should be added:

**Example**:
- Current: `intraday_brokerage: 20`
- Proposed: `intraday: { amount: 20, formula: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever lower)", notes: "Per executed order" }`

**Reason**: Users currently see only "‚Çπ20" but miss the "or 0.03%" condition

**Apply to all 16 brokers?**

‚úÖ YES - Add formulas for all brokers
‚ùå NO - Keep simple numbers only
‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Only add for partner brokers
