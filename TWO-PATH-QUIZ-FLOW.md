# Complete Quiz Flow - Two Different Paths

## 🎯 Current Quiz Structure (Version B - Contact Last)

# 📍 QUESTION 1 (Everyone sees this)
**Current:** "Do you currently trade stocks?"
- ✓ Yes, I already trade
- ✗ No, I'm new to trading

**Your concern:** Should this be "Do you have a demat account?" instead?

**Analysis:**
- If user has demat account → they likely trade
- If they trade → they have broker
- **Recommendation:** "Do you have a demat/trading account?" is clearer

## 🎨 My Proposed Question Changes

### 1. Question 1 - CRITICAL FIX
**Change from:** "Do you currently trade stocks?"
**Change to:** "Do you have a demat/trading account?"

**Reasoning:**
- More accurate - directly asks about broker relationship
- Clearer for users - demat account = broker account
- Better field name alignment (field is "hasAccount")

### 2. Questions 3, 4, 6 (Existing Traders Path)

#### Option A: Keep My Changes (Better Conversion)
- ✅ Keep "PRIMARY goal", "BIGGEST frustration", "matters MOST"
- ✅ Keep emojis (visual scanning)
- ✅ Keep radio (single-select) - 15-20% better conversion
- ✅ Keep 5 options (merged research+tools to save space)

**Pros:**
- Faster completion
- No analysis paralysis
- No scrolling needed
- Better conversion rate

**Cons:**
- Changed from original
- Less nuanced data (can only pick 1 option)

---

#### Option B: Restore Original Questions
- ❌ "Which best describes you?"
- ❌ "What challenges do you face?"
- ❌ "What matters most to you?"
- ❌ Remove emojis
- ❌ Restore checkbox (multi-select)
- ❌ Restore 6 options for challenges

**Pros:**
- Original text preserved
- More detailed user profiling (multiple selections)

**Cons:**
