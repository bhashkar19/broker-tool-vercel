# üîç COMPARISON TABLE DATA AUDIT

## üìä WHAT THIS FILE DOES

This file contains the **pricing data shown in the comparison table** when users see their broker recommendation. The `BrokerComparisonWidget` component uses this data to show:

1. **Delivery charges** comparison
2. **Intraday charges** comparison
3. **Savings calculator** (monthly/yearly)
4. **Feature comparison**

**Critical:** This is what users see before deciding to switch brokers!

## üö® ERRORS FOUND IN COMPARISON TABLE DATA

### **1. UPSTOX - CORRECT** ‚úÖ

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 2.5% (whichever is lower)",
intraday: "‚Çπ20 or 0.05% (whichever is lower)",
amc: "‚Çπ300/year"
```

**Official 2025:** ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**
- Delivery: ‚Çπ20 or 2.5% ‚úì
- Intraday: ‚Çπ20 or 0.05% ‚úì (some sources say 0.1%)
- AMC: ‚Çπ300/year (‚Çπ0 first year) ‚úì

**Status:** ‚úÖ Good

---

### **2. ANGEL ONE - OUTDATED** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ0 (discount plan) or ‚Çπ10-20 (advisory plan)",
amc: "‚Çπ0 (discount) or ‚Çπ500-999/month (advisory)"
```

**Official 2025:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY WRONG**
- Delivery: **‚Çπ20 or 0.1%** since Nov 1, 2024 (NOT ‚Çπ0!)
- AMC: ‚Çπ240/year from 2nd year (‚Çπ60/quarter)
- Notes: First 30 days free, then charged

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
angel_one: {
  delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 0.1% (whichever is lower) - First 30 days free",
  intraday: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever is lower)",
  fo: "‚Çπ20 flat per order",
  amc: "‚Çπ0 (1st year), then ‚Çπ240/year",
  demat_opening: "‚Çπ0",
  notes: "Delivery NO LONGER FREE since Nov 1, 2024. First 30 days promotional period only"
}
```

---

### **3. FYERS - NEEDS VERIFICATION** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ0",
intraday: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever is lower)",
amc: "‚Çπ0 (first year), ‚Çπ400/year (subsequent)"
```

**Official Website Says:** ü§î **AMBIGUOUS**
- Delivery: "Max ‚Çπ20 across all segments" (not clear if free or ‚Çπ20)
- AMC: "Free AMC for Life" promotional banner (but standard might be ‚Çπ400)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
fyers: {
  delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 0.3% (whichever is lower) - Check for zero promo",
  intraday: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever is lower)",
  fo: "‚Çπ20 flat per order",
  amc: "‚Çπ0 (promotional) or ‚Çπ400/year (standard) - Check current offer",
  demat_opening: "‚Çπ0",
  notes: "Promotional 'Free AMC for Life' offer active. Delivery charges vary - confirm before opening"
}
```

---

### **4. 5PAISA - WRONG** üî¥

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ10 or 0.5% (whichever is lower)",
intraday: "‚Çπ10 or 0.05% (whichever is lower)",
fo: "‚Çπ10 or 0.05% (whichever is lower)",
amc: "‚Çπ0"
```

**Official 2025:** üî¥ **MOSTLY WRONG**
- **Standard Plan:** ‚Çπ20 flat (NOT ‚Çπ10!)
- **Premium Plans:** ‚Çπ10 (requires ‚Çπ599-1199/month subscription)
- **AMC:** Tiered based on holdings:
  - ‚Çπ0 for BSDA (< ‚Çπ4L holdings)
  - ‚Çπ100/year (‚Çπ4-10L holdings)
  - ‚Çπ300/year (> ‚Çπ10L holdings)

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
'5paisa': {
  delivery: "‚Çπ20 flat (standard) or ‚Çπ10 (premium subscription ‚Çπ599-1199/mo)",
  intraday: "‚Çπ20 flat (standard) or ‚Çπ10 (premium subscription)",
  fo: "‚Çπ20 flat (standard) or ‚Çπ10 (premium subscription)",
  amc: "‚Çπ0 (< ‚Çπ4L holdings), ‚Çπ100/year (‚Çπ4-10L), ‚Çπ300/year (> ‚Çπ10L)",
  demat_opening: "‚Çπ0",
  notes: "Standard plan: ‚Çπ20 flat. Premium plans (‚Çπ10 brokerage) require monthly subscription"
}
```

---

### **5. ZERODHA - PERFECT** ‚úÖ

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ0",
intraday: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever is lower)",
fo: "‚Çπ20 or 0.03% (whichever is lower)",
amc: "‚Çπ300/year"
```

**Official 2025:** ‚úÖ **100% ACCURATE**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Perfect

---

## üìä NON-PARTNER BROKERS (Also in Table)

### **GROWW - Needs Update**

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 0.1% (whichever is lower, min ‚Çπ5)",
notes: "Pricing updated June 21, 2025"
```

**Issue:** Date says "June 21, 2025" but we're in January 2025!
**Fix:** Change to "Pricing as of January 2025"

### **Other Brokers:**
- Dhan: ‚úÖ Looks accurate
- Paytm: ‚úÖ Looks accurate
- Traditional brokers (ICICI, HDFC, etc.): ‚ö†Ô∏è Need verification

## üéØ IMPACT ON COMPARISON WIDGET

### **Example: Angel One ‚Üí Zerodha Comparison**

**Current Display (WRONG):**
```
Delivery Charges:
Angel One: ‚Çπ0 ‚ùå WRONG!
Zerodha: ‚Çπ0
Savings: ‚Çπ0/month (no difference)
```

**Should Show (CORRECT):**
```
Delivery Charges:
Angel One: ‚Çπ20/0.1% ‚úÖ
Zerodha: ‚Çπ0 ‚úÖ
Savings: ‚Çπ20/trade = ‚Çπ100-400/month ‚úÖ
```

**User Impact:**
- ‚ùå Currently: Users don't see the savings from switching
- ‚úÖ After fix: Clear ‚Çπ100-400/month savings shown!

---

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

### **Priority 1: Angel One (URGENT)** üî¥

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
delivery: "‚Çπ0 (discount plan) or ‚Çπ10-20 (advisory plan)",

// AFTER (CORRECT):
delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 0.1% (whichever is lower)",
```

**Why Critical:** False advertising! Showing free delivery when it's not.

---

### **Priority 2: 5paisa (HIGH)** üî¥

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - ‚Çπ10):
delivery: "‚Çπ10 or 0.5% (whichever is lower)",
intraday: "‚Çπ10 or 0.05% (whichever is lower)",
amc: "‚Çπ0",

// AFTER (CORRECT - ‚Çπ20 standard):
delivery: "‚Çπ20 flat (standard) or ‚Çπ10 (with premium subscription)",
intraday: "‚Çπ20 flat (standard) or ‚Çπ10 (with premium subscription)",
amc: "‚Çπ0 (BSDA < ‚Çπ4L), ‚Çπ100-300/year (based on holdings)",
```

**Why Critical:** Misleading users about standard pricing.

---

### **Priority 3: Fyers (MEDIUM)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

```typescript
// CURRENT (UNCLEAR):
delivery: "‚Çπ0",
amc: "‚Çπ0 (first year), ‚Çπ400/year (subsequent)",

// RECOMMENDED (CLEARER):
delivery: "‚Çπ20 or 0.3% - Zero delivery promos available",
amc: "‚Çπ0 (promotional 'Free for Life') or ‚Çπ400/year (standard)",
notes: "Verify current promotional offers before account opening"
```

**Why Important:** Ambiguous official data needs clarification.
