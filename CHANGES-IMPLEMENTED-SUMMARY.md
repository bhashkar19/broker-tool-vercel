```typescript
"India's largest broker with 1.6 crore+ active users - highest trust and liquidity"
```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
"1.6 crore+ clients, India's 2nd largest broker by active users (7.4M) - high trust and liquidity"
```

**Reason**: Groww overtook Zerodha in September 2023. Groww has 12.35M active clients vs Zerodha's 7.4M.

**Sources**: Business Standard, Statista, NSE data (Jan 2025)

---

### ‚úÖ Change #2: Zerodha - Softened Cost Claim
**File**: `src/config/brokerConfigs.ts` (Line 50)

**BEFORE**:

"Strong customer support with actual humans (rare in discount broking)"
```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
"Angel SpeedPro trading platform with advanced features"

### ‚úÖ Change #11: Fyers - Updated AMC to Lifetime Free
**File**: `src/config/brokerConfigs.ts` (Line 221)

**BEFORE**:

### ‚úÖ Change #14: 5paisa - Updated AMC Tier Information (Pros)
**File**: `src/config/brokerConfigs.ts` (Lines 241-245)

  "‚Çπ0 AMC for BSDA accounts (holdings under ‚Çπ4 lakh)",
  "Premium plans available: ‚Çπ10 brokerage with subscription (‚Çπ599-1199/month)",

]
```

```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
"Tiered AMC structure: ‚Çπ0 (<‚Çπ50k), ‚Çπ96/year (‚Çπ50k-2L), ‚Çπ300/year (>‚Çπ2L holdings) - can confuse users"
