## üéØ PROJECT BRIEF

### **What We Need:**
Facebook/Instagram ad creatives (images, videos, copy) for broker discovery tool

### **Business Goal:**
Drive high-quality conversions (actual broker account openings), not just clicks or leads

### **Target Audience:**
Indian traders/investors aged 25-45 looking for stock brokers

### **Campaign Objective:**
Conversions (Purchase event = account opening at recommended broker)

---

## üß† CORE UNDERSTANDING (Read This First!)

### **What We Are:**
A FREE tool that matches traders with the right broker for their specific needs (like a dating app for brokers)

### **What We Are NOT:**
- ‚ùå NOT a broker ourselves
- ‚ùå NOT selling anything
- ‚ùå NOT recommending "the best" broker (there's no universal best)
- ‚ùå NOT competing on price (all brokers have similar pricing)

### **Our Unique Value:**
**PERSONALIZED MATCHING** based on individual trading style, not generic "best broker" lists

### **User Problem We Solve:**
- 50+ brokers in India = overwhelming choice
- Every trader has different needs (frequency, budget, segments, experience)
- Most people choose randomly (friend's recommendation, first ad they see)
- This leads to wrong fit ‚Üí frustration

### **Our Solution:**
- 60-second quiz analyzing trading style
- Smart algorithm matches with best-fit broker
- Not "cheapest" or "most popular" - the RIGHT FIT for them
- 100% free, no signup, instant results

## üìä HOW WE MAKE MONEY (Context for Messaging)

### **Revenue Model:**
Affiliate commissions when user opens account at recommended broker

| User Type | Commission | Conversion Priority |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **New user** (no demat account) | ‚Çπ300-400 | **HIGH** (target these!) |
| Existing user (switching) | ‚Çπ200-300 | Medium |

**Key Insight for Creatives:**
- New users = higher value (focus messaging on beginners)
- But don't exclude experienced traders (they convert too)

**Unit Economics:**
- Cost per lead: ‚Çπ30-50 (acceptable)
- Cost per acquisition: ‚Çπ250-400 (target)
- Revenue per conversion: ‚Çπ300-350
- Breakeven/slight profit

**What This Means for Ads:**
- Focus on QUALITY leads (high intent), not quantity
- Optimize for conversions, not clicks
- Message should attract serious traders, not casual browsers
