# Complete Question History - Original vs Current

## üóÑÔ∏è Evidence from Database Schema

From `supabase/migrations/001_create_user_submissions.sql`, the ORIGINAL database fields were:

```sql
current_broker VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
execution_issues VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
tools_satisfaction VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
support_experience VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
charges_concern VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
```

This tells us the **ORIGINAL QUESTIONS** were likely:
1. **Current broker** - "Which broker do you use?" or "Who is your current broker?"
2. **Execution issues** - "Do you face execution/speed issues?"
3. **Tools satisfaction** - "Are you satisfied with trading tools?"
4. **Support experience** - "How is your support experience?"
5. **Charges concern** - "Are charges a concern for you?"

## üîÑ What You Remember (Needs Confirmation)

You mentioned the question was something like:
> "Do you have a demat account?" or similar

**I could NOT find this in git history**, which means either:
1. It was changed BEFORE the git commits started
2. It was only in production database/live site
3. It was in a different branch that got deleted
