## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### **For Your Comparison Widget:**

1. **Savings Calculation Accuracy:**
   - ✅ Works great for discount brokers (flat ₹20)
   - ⚠️ Traditional brokers use % - assumes ₹1L trade size
   - 💡 Consider adding trade size input for more accuracy

2. **Logo Strategy:**
   - ✅ Using emoji fallbacks for now (🏦 🏛️ 🔷 etc.)
   - 💡 Upload actual logos to Supabase for better branding
   - 💡 Or use official CDN URLs from broker websites

3. **Affiliate Links:**
   - ✅ Currently pointing to official account opening pages
   - 💡 Replace with your affiliate links when partnerships confirmed
   - 💡 Non-partners: Use for "current broker" selection only

4. **Pricing Updates:**
   - ⚠️ Promotional offers may expire (HDFC, Sharekhan)
   - 💡 Review quarterly or when brokers announce changes
   - 💡 Add "Last updated: [date]" to pricing notes

### **Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Keep partner brokers (Zerodha, Angel One, Upstox, Fyers, 5paisa) as primary recommendations
- Show all 16 brokers in "current broker" selection
- Use comparison widget to justify switches
- Track which comparisons convert best

❌ **DON'T:**
- Recommend non-partner brokers as primary (no commission)
- Show outdated pricing (update quarterly)
- Claim savings without data backing
- Make unrealistic promises
