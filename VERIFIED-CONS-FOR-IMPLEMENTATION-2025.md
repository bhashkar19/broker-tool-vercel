- ✅ Confirmed as deal-breakers (not minor issues)
- ✅ Cross-referenced with multiple sources

---

## 1. GROWW (3 CONS - Use All)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Customer support rated 2.28/5 on MouthShut despite 24/7 phone availability",
  "Delivery brokerage charged (₹20 or 0.1% whichever lower, min ₹5) while discount brokers offer free delivery",
  "Platform can experience recurring technical glitches during peak trading periods"
]
```

**Notes:**

## 2. DHAN (0 CONS - Excellent Broker!)

```typescript
cons: [
  // No major cons - this is actually a very solid broker!
  // Optional minor cons if needed:
  // "Relatively newer broker (founded 2021) with smaller community compared to established players",
  // "Limited advanced charting tools compared to premium platforms"
]
```

**Notes:**
- **BETTER THAN EXPECTED**: 80% complaint resolution, only 10 complaints total
- Cheaper than Zerodha (₹0 AMC vs ₹300)
- All proposed cons were historical (2023-2024) or could not be verified for 2025

---

## 3. PAYTM MONEY (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "No NRI accounts or commodity (MCX) trading - limited to equity and F&O only",
  "Customer satisfaction rating 2.29/5 - users report account access and fund blocking issues"
]
```

**Notes:**
- Do NOT mention parent company RBI restrictions (different entity - Paytm Payments Bank, not Paytm Money broker)
- Paytm Money is properly SEBI-regulated and unaffected by Payments Bank issues

---

## 4. ICICI DIRECT (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Low customer satisfaction (2.06/5 on MouthShut) with poor complaint resolution - only 35% of issues resolved",

```

**Notes:**

  "Platform experienced 30-40 minute outage during market hours in April 2025 - recurring technical issues reported",
  "Lowest customer satisfaction among major brokers - rated 1.5/5 on MouthShut",
  "Unauthorized trading complaints reported, particularly in F&O and intraday segments"
]
```

**Notes:**
- April 8, 2025 outage verified (BusinessToday article)

---

## 6. KOTAK SECURITIES (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Lowest customer satisfaction among major brokers - rated 1.38/5 on MouthShut",
  "Higher delivery charges (0.20% = ₹200 per ₹1L) compared to discount brokers at ₹0-20"
]
```

**Notes:**

---

## 7. SHAREKHAN (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Cannot close account online - requires branch visit with physical forms and takes 7-15 working days to process",
  "Hundreds of customers report continued AMC charges years after submitting closure request - keep closure proof"
]
```

**Notes:**
- Account closure: ₹150 fee, 7 days processing + 15 days confirmation
- AMC after closure is documented widespread issue affecting "hundreds yearly"
- Must keep copy of closure request to protect from ongoing charges

---

## 8. SBI SECURITIES (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Extremely low customer satisfaction (1.43/5 on MouthShut) despite SBI's trusted brand",
  "App stability issues reported - crashes, frequent logouts, and order placement problems"
]
```

**Notes:**
- Do NOT mention 0.50% delivery charge (FALSE - SBI now offers ₹0 FREE delivery!)
- App Store rating is 3.8/5 (decent) but specific complaints about crashes/logouts verified
- SBI Securities has VERY COMPETITIVE pricing now (₹0 delivery, ₹0 AMC)

---

## 9. MOTILAL OSWAL (3 CONS - Use All)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Low customer rating (1.85/5) - advisors reported giving false commitments and unsuitable product recommendations",

  "Higher delivery charges (0.20%) compared to discount brokers offering ₹0-20"
]
```

**Notes:**

  // Optional minor cons if needed:
  // "Multiple pricing plans may require comparison to find best fit",
  // "Higher brokerage on some plans compared to pure discount brokers"
]
```

**Notes:**
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT mention SEBI ban (OVERTURNED by SAT in December 2023!)
- Do NOT mention "less transparency" (no evidence, contradicted by 4.3/5 rating)
- IIFL is operating normally in 2025, can onboard new clients
- High platform rating (4.3/5), multiple clear pricing plans available

---

## 11. AXIS DIRECT (2 CONS - Use Both)

```typescript
cons: [
  "Trade@20 requires ₹75,000 average quarterly balance (or ₹250/month subscription) - high barrier for beginners",
  "Automatically reverts to expensive 0.50% delivery brokerage if balance requirement not met or 1 trade per quarter missed"
]
```

**Notes:**
- This is a "trap" for small investors - looks competitive but easy to fall into expensive plan
- Default plan: 0.50% = ₹500 per ₹1L (25x more expensive than discount brokers)
- Must maintain ₹75k AQB AND execute 1 trade per quarter to keep ₹20 plan
