## 🚨 CRITICAL ERRORS FOUND

### **1. ANGEL ONE - MAJOR PRICING ERROR** 🔴

**Your Data (WRONG):**
```typescript
delivery_brokerage: 20,  // ❌ Partially correct
amc_charges: 240         // ❌ WRONG
```

**Official 2025 Pricing:**
```
✅ Delivery: ₹20 or 0.1% (whichever is lower) - Changed Nov 1, 2024
✅ AMC: ₹60/quarter from 2nd year = ₹240/year (1st year FREE)
```

**Your real_insights says:** "Delivery trading NO LONGER FREE since Nov 1, 2024"
**But your charges show:** `delivery_brokerage: 20` (should specify "from Nov 2024")

**Issue:** Your AMC is correct (₹240), but missing the "first year free" detail.

---

### **2. UPSTOX - CRITICAL PRICING ERROR** 🔴

**Your Data (WRONG):**
```typescript
delivery_brokerage: 0,   // ❌ COMPLETELY WRONG!
amc_charges: 150         // ❌ WRONG!
```

**Official 2025 Pricing:**
```
✅ Delivery: ₹20 or 0.1% (whichever is lower) - NOT FREE!
✅ AMC: ₹0 first year, then ₹300/year (not ₹150)
```

**Impact:** **MAJOR** - You're telling users Upstox has free delivery when it doesn't!

**Your real_insights says:** "Free delivery trading forever like Zerodha"
**This is FALSE!** Upstox charges ₹20/0.1% for delivery.

---

### **3. FYERS - PRICING ERROR** 🔴

**Your Data (WRONG):**
```typescript
delivery_brokerage: 0,   // ❌ WRONG!
amc_charges: 400         // ❌ WRONG!
```

**Official 2025 Pricing:**
```
✅ Delivery: ₹20 or 0.3% (whichever is lower) - NOT FREE!
✅ AMC: ₹0 (Free lifetime AMC)
```

**Impact:** **MAJOR** - You're charging users ₹400 AMC when it's actually free!

**Your real_insights says:** "Free delivery trading like other discount brokers"
**This is FALSE!** Fyers charges ₹20/0.3% for delivery.

---

### **4. 5PAISA - PRICING ERROR** 🔴

**Your Data (WRONG):**
```typescript
delivery_brokerage: 10,  // ✅ Correct
amc_charges: 0           // ❌ WRONG!
```

**Official 2025 Pricing:**
```
✅ Delivery: Flat ₹20 per order (NOT ₹10!)
✅ AMC: ₹300/year (NOT ₹0)
   - BUT: ₹0 for BSDA (holdings < ₹50K)
   - ₹8/month for ₹50K-2L holdings
   - ₹25/month for 2L+ holdings
```

**Impact:** **MAJOR** - Wrong delivery charge AND wrong AMC!

---

## ✅ CORRECT DATA

### **ZERODHA - ACCURATE** ✅

**Your Data:**
```typescript
delivery_brokerage: 0,       // ✅ Correct
intraday_brokerage: 20,      // ✅ Correct (or 0.03%)
fo_brokerage: 20,            // ✅ Correct (or 0.03%)
