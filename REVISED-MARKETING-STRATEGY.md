# Revised Marketing Strategy - Broker Discovery Tool

## üéØ CORE MESSAGE SHIFT

### ‚ùå OLD (WRONG) MESSAGE:
"Find the cheapest broker and save money!"

### ‚úÖ NEW (RIGHT) MESSAGE:
"Discover the broker that perfectly matches YOUR trading style and needs"

---

## üß† WHY THIS MATTERS

**The Problem:**
- You CAN'T compete on price (everyone's similar)
- You CAN'T say "Broker X is best" (they're all good)

**The Solution:**
- Focus on **PERSONALIZED MATCHING**
- Focus on **REDUCING CONFUSION**
- Focus on **CONFIDENCE IN CHOICE**

It's like a dating app for brokers - not "cheapest date" but "best match for YOU"
