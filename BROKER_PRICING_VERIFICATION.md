## 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC ISSUE

### The Problem:
1. If user has **Groww/Dhan/Paytm** (non-partners)
2. And we show pricing comparison
3. Our partner brokers may look MORE EXPENSIVE
4. User thinks: "Why pay more?" → No conversion ❌

### Solution Options:

#### Option A: HIDE pricing if not favorable
```
IF (recommended_broker_price >= current_broker_price) {
  HIDE pricing comparison
  FOCUS on features/tools/service instead
}
```

#### Option B: SHOW pricing only when we're cheaper
```
IF (recommended_broker_price < current_broker_price) {
  SHOW pricing comparison with savings
} ELSE {
  HIDE pricing, highlight other benefits
}
```

#### Option C: Smart messaging based on price
```
IF (current = cheap broker like Dhan):
  "Dhan has great pricing, but [partner] offers better tools/support/reliability"

IF (current = expensive broker like ICICI):
  "Save ₹X,XXX per year by switching to [partner]!"
```

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **VERIFY PRICING** - Visit each official website, update data, mark as verified
2. **DECIDE STRATEGY** - Choose Option A/B/C for handling non-partner comparisons
3. **UPDATE CODE** - Implement smart pricing display logic
4. **TEST** - Ensure conversion doesn't drop when user has cheap non-partner broker

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

**For Traditional Brokers (ICICI/HDFC/etc) → Partner Brokers:**
✅ SHOW pricing - massive savings story

**For Discount Non-Partners (Groww/Dhan) → Partner Brokers:**
❌ HIDE pricing - focus on features/tools/service/trust

**For Partner → Partner (secondary account):**
✅ SHOW pricing if different, or hide if similar
